</head>
<body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The HS Division and Percentage Calculator is an online calculation tool. It helps the students to calculate the percentage, grade and division by using their total marks. And students can also calculate using their marks of individual subjects.</p>
    <p>This tool is especially useful for students who want to know their percentage, grade and division for higher institutional admission.</p>

    <h2>Formula of Uchcha Madhyamik Percentage Calculator</h2>
    <p>Percentage = (Total Marks Obtained / Total Maximum Marks) * 100</p>
    <p>Here, <strong>Total Marks Obtained</strong> = First Language + Second Language + Subject 3 + Subject 4 + Subject 5 (best 3 subjects + first and second language is compulsory)<br>
    <strong>Total Maximum Marks</strong> = 500</p>
    <p>To calculate the percentage of total marks obtained in Uchcha Madhyamik, we first divide the total obtained marks by maximum marks. Then we multiply it into 100.</p>

    <h2>Formula of Uchcha Madhyamik Grade Calculator</h2>
    <p>Grades are usually assigned based on percentage ranges. For Uchcha Madhyamik:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AA (90% to 100%): Outstanding</li>
        <li>A+ (80% to 89%): Excellent</li>
        <li>A (70% to 79%): Very good</li>
        <li>B+ (60% to 69%): Good</li>
        <li>B (50% to 59%): Satisfactory</li>
        <li>C (30% to 49%): Marginal</li>
        <li>D (below 30%): Disqualified</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To calculate the grade, we first calculate the percentage. Then we check according to this chart.</p>

    <h2>Formula of Uchcha Madhyamik Division Calculator</h2>
    <p>Divisions are based on total marks obtained. For Uchcha Madhyamik:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Superstar First Division: total obtained marks >= 450</li>
        <li>Star First Division: total obtained marks >= 400</li>
        <li>High First Division: total obtained marks >= 350</li>
        <li>First Division: total obtained marks >= 300</li>
        <li>Second Division: total obtained marks >= 250</li>
        <li>Third Division: total obtained marks >= 150</li>
        <li>No Division: total obtained marks < 150</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To calculate the division, we first calculate the total obtained marks. Then we check according to this chart.</p>

    <h2>Formula of HS Pass or Fail Calculator</h2>
    <p>In Uchcha Madhyamik, students need to achieve a minimum of 30 marks in every subject to pass. Uchcha Madhyamik pass mark is 150 out of 500, i.e. 30%. Here, to pass or fail calculations, students need to fill in all the subject boxes.</p>

    <h2>Example of HS Division and Percentage Calculator</h2>
    <p>Suppose 460 is the total obtained marks of a student. In this case, the output is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Total Score: 460</li>
        <li>Percentage: 65.71%</li>
        <li>Grade: A (Very good)</li>
        <li>Division: First Division</li>
        <li>Status: Pass</li>
    </ul>
